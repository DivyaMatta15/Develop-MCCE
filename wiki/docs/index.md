# Welcome to MCCE website

MCCE (Multi-Conformation Continuum Electrostatics) is a biophysics simulation program combining continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics. In this program, the protein side chain motions are simulated explicitly while the dielectric effect of solvent and bulk protein material is modeled by continuum electrostatics.

## What can MCCE do?
MCCE can calculate:

  * residue pka, cofactor Em and protein PI in protein-solvent systems;
  * protein structural responses to changes in charge;
  * residue ionization changes in response to protein structural changes;
  * location and stoichiometry of proton transfers coupled to electron transfer

## Project at a Glance:
MCCE is a program developed at Marilyn Gunner's lab in City College of New York. Current development focuses are on the following aspects:

  * change residue/cofactor topology file into free format to make the procedure of integrating a new ligand easier.
  * make program friendly to distribute and easy to maintain.
  * develop tool sets to analyze MCCE results.
  * develop protein pKa database to include all known structures listed in the PDB.
