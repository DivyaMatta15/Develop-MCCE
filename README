# Suggestions to developers

## Code organization
* Use Python 3
* Read PEP 8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) 
* Read PEP 20 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) 
* Put constants, data structure and reusable functions in pymcce.py so that the main program keeps focus on program flow.
* Put all python scripts in ```bin/```
* Put all program documentation in ```doc/```


## Print and log messages
Use print() to print program result and logging module to print messages, allowing users to set verbose mode and 
level, and module functions to run at quiet mode.

| Task | What to use |
| --- | --- |
| Display program output  | print() |
| Debug information | logging.debug() |
| Confirmation that things are working as expected | logging.info() |
| Warning but program is still running | logging.warning() |
| Unexpected error that may cause program to stop or produce wrong result | logging.error() | 
| Serious error that will break the program | logging.critical() |
